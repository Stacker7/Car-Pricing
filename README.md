# Car-Pricing
Repo of project that highlights the Exploratory Data Analysis of Car Pricing dataset from Kaggle.
Here we perform, step by step, feature engineering and analysis. We understand the steps taken when we start with raw dataset. The goal is to convert raw data into a usabe format ready to be put in a machine learning model. We also provide some visualizations to better understand the data like Histograms, Boxplots and Scatterplots.
